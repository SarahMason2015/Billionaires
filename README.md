## Exploratory Data Analysis

<p> There are several definitions of what constitutes being rich. Technically, any person can be rich. Rich with love, family, or sometimes even happiness, things money can’t buy. The type of rich we will be discussing goes beyond emotional fulfillment, adding guac at chipotle, or the ability to afford a luxury vehicle. The kind of rich we will be diving into are not just the rich, but super-rich, billionaires.

<p>Billionaires hold more wealth than 60% of the world’s population. In this final project we are going to answer some of the biggest questions surrounding the super-rich. We will utilize many skills we've learned throughout this course such as: analyzing and breakdown the data using python pandas, creating a database using SQL, as well as visualizing our findings in Tableau.

<p>By the end of this project, we will answer and illustrate following:

  -     What regions of the world produce the most billionaires?
  -     What countries produce the most billionaires?
  -     How did they become super-rich? Was it earned, or inherited?
