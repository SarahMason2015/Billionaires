## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Machine Learning
Our training and testing setup is SQL. Extra ML verbiage here.

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on Tableau.

Our Dashboards will consist of heat maps, pie charts, and bar graphs.
