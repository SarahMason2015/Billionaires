# Machine Learning Model
Final Project

#### Define adequately our problem (objective, desired outputs…).
- Are billionaires born or are they made? We want to examine information about billionaires to see if anyone can be one--or whether our birth matters.
- We also hope to predict how many MORE billionaires will be minted between now and 2035.
#### Gather data
- We will gather data from the Billionaires dataset, which we found on the [CORGIS Dataset base](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/billionaires/)
#### Choose a measure of success.
- Our first question seeks classification: Are billionaires born or made? Are there specific countries that create them, or are they equitably spread out?
- Our second question is a simple regression problem: we want to plot the growth in the number of billionaires and predict the value in 2035
#### Set an evaluation protocol and the different protocols available.
- Prepare the data (dealing with missing values, with categorial values…).
- Spilit correctly the data.
- Differentiate between over and underfitting, defining what they are and explaining the best ways to avoid them.
- An overview of how a model learns.
- What is regularization and when is appropiate to use it.
- Develop a benchmark model.
- Choose an adequate model and tune it to get the best performance possible.


Regression problems use certain evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE).
Classification problems use evaluation metrics as precision, accuracy and recall.
