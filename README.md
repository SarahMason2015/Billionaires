**<h1>Billionaires</h1>**

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

<p> Rich can be defined many ways. Technically, any person can be rich. Rich with love, or family. The things money can’t buy. The rich we will be discussing goes beyond the ability to afford to add guac at chipotle, or even afford a luxury vehicle. The kind of rich we will be diving into are not just the rich, but super-rich, billionaires. 

<p>Billionaires hold more wealth than 60% of the world’s population. In this final project we are going to answer some of the biggest questions surrounding the super-rich. We will utilize many skills we learned throughout this course such as: analyzing and breakdown the data using python pandas, create a database using SQL, as well as presenting our findings in Tableau. 
  
<p>By the end of this project, we will answer and illustrate following:
  
  -	What regions of the world produce the most billionaires? 
  -	What countries produce the most billionaires?
  -	How did they become super-rich? Was it earned, or inherited?
